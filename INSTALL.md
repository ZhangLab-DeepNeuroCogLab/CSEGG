# Install Packages

## Conda Environments

``` bash
# first, make sure that your conda is setup properly with the right environment
# for that, check that `which conda`, `which pip` and `which python` points to the
# right path. From a clean conda env, this is what you need to do

conda create -y --name sggc
conda activate sggc
```
